# Single_Inheritance
This repository contains a basic example of Single Inheritance in Java. It shows how a subclass can inherit properties and methods from a single parent class. 
This concept is a part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
 What's Included:
1:A base class (parent) with some common properties and methods.
2:A derived class (child) that extends the base class.
3:A main class to run and test the inheritance concept.
